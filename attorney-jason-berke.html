      <h2>Representative Accomplishments</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Fraudulent conveyance:</strong> Summary judgment granted on claim alleging actual intent to defraud involving transfer of real estate from husband and wife as tenants by the entirety to wife only. On reargument, the court awarded <strong>$500,000+ money judgment</strong> and <strong>counsel fees</strong> rather than reverting the transfer where the sole debtor was the husband.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal default judgment vacated:</strong> Motion granted to vacate a 14-year-old SDNY default judgment exceeding <strong>$180,000</strong> (plus statutory interest) after a second remand from the Second Circuit. Matter resolved for <strong>$25,000</strong> following an FRCP 68 offer—approximately <strong>$375,000</strong> less than the accrued judgment with interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Divorce settlement enforcement:</strong> Summary judgment granted on breach of a divorce settlement for failure to remove client/husband from a mortgage. In related post-judgment litigation, the court agreed contract interpretation required <strong>time-of-the-essence performance</strong>. Escrow funds of <strong>$62,500</strong> were returned to the client.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreclosure defense (issue of first impression):</strong> Motion to dismiss a diversity foreclosure action granted where plaintiff failed to serve RPAPL 1304 notice on the borrower. The court held RPAPL 1304 was required even if the borrower no longer resided in or owned the property. Mortgage was ultimately forgiven after further motion practice.</li>

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Landlord/tenant and real estate cases often hinge on details: what was served, when it was served, what the lease requires, what the rent ledger shows,
        and how the timeline matches statutory requirements. The firm focuses on building a clear narrative and supporting it with documents and procedural rigor.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Early issue-spotting:</strong> service, jurisdiction, and notice defects</li>
        <li><strong>Document-first strategy:</strong> leases, riders, notices, ledger, communications</li>
        <li><strong>Motion practice:</strong> targeted motions to narrow or resolve the case</li>
        <li><strong>Trial readiness:</strong> organized evidence and witness preparation</li>
      </ul>
