  <div class="card"><h2>What a Holdover Proceeding Is</h2><p>
A holdover is a Housing Court (or sometimes Supreme Court) case seeking possession. Unlike nonpayment cases, the central issue is often not arrears but whether the landlord is entitled to remove the occupant.
Holdovers can involve lease expiration, alleged violations, nuisance allegations, or termination notices. In commercial settings, they may involve complex lease terms and cure provisions.
</p></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Predicate Notices and Timing</h2><p>
Holdover cases commonly require specific notices (e.g., notice to cure, notice of termination, or other predicate notices depending on circumstances).
Courts frequently scrutinize <strong>how</strong> and <strong>when</strong> notices were served, what they stated, and whether the tenant was afforded required cure opportunities.
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Notice content:</strong> Does it clearly identify the alleged breach and what must be done to cure?</li>
<li><strong>Service method:</strong> Was it served in an allowed manner, on the right person, and documented properly?</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Did the landlord wait the required period between notices and court papers?</li>
</ul></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Common Holdover Scenarios</h2><ul class="list">
<li><strong>Lease expiration:</strong> landlord seeks possession after lease term ends.</li>
<li><strong>Alleged breach:</strong> lease violations, unauthorized occupants, pets, alterations, or improper use.</li>
<li><strong>Nuisance allegations:</strong> fact-intensive claims requiring credible evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial holdovers:</strong> disputes about defaults, cure rights, and lease interpretation.</li>
</ul></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Defense Strategy and Evidence</h2><p>
Defense work often starts with a timeline and document review: leases, notices, communications, and service affidavits. Many cases improve materially when service/notice issues are identified early.
If the dispute is factual, the focus becomes evidence: what happened, who observed it, and what documents corroborate it.
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Challenge predicate notices and service where appropriate</li>
<li>Evaluate cure rights and compliance</li>
<li>Develop factual record for hearings/trial</li>
<li>Negotiate stipulations that avoid unintended defaults</li>
</ul></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Landlord Strategy: Building a Strong Record</h2><p>
For landlords, success often requires a clean procedural record and credible proof. The firm helps landlords ensure notices comply with applicable requirements and that the case is ready to be proven—through documents, witnesses, and, when needed, motion practice.
