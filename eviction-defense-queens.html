  <div class="card"><h2>What “Eviction Defense” Usually Means</h2><p>
Eviction defense is not one single type of case—it is the set of strategies used to protect a tenant’s rights and housing stability in Housing Court (and sometimes Supreme Court).
Defense work may involve a nonpayment proceeding, holdover proceeding, or a related motion (e.g., to vacate a default or to stay enforcement).
</p></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Immediate Steps If You’ve Been Served</h2><ol class="list">
<li><strong>Do not ignore the court date.</strong> Missing appearances can lead to default judgments.</li>
<li><strong>Gather documents:</strong> lease, renewals, rent receipts, notices, photos, and communications.</li>
<li><strong>Write a timeline:</strong> key dates for notice receipt, payments, repairs, and communications.</li>
<li><strong>Confirm service details:</strong> how papers were delivered, to whom, and when.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note"><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you received papers by “nail and mail” or substituted service, note exactly where they were posted and when you received the mailing.</p></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Common Defense Themes</h2><ul class="list">
<li><strong>Service/jurisdiction defenses:</strong> improper service can undermine jurisdiction.</li>
<li><strong>Notice defects:</strong> predicate notice problems can be case-dispositive.</li>
<li><strong>Disputed arrears:</strong> incorrect ledgers, missing credits, improper charges.</li>
<li><strong>Condition defenses:</strong> habitability issues may support abatements (fact-specific).</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory protections:</strong> where applicable, rent stabilization and related requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The firm assesses which defenses are strongest and how to use them: for dismissal, leverage in settlement, or to narrow the dispute for hearing/trial.
</p></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Negotiating Stipulations Safely</h2><p>
Many eviction cases resolve by stipulation. However, stipulations can include strict deadlines and default provisions. The firm focuses on making sure stipulations are realistic and protective:
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Clear payment schedules and grace periods where appropriate</li>
<li>Defined repair obligations and inspection language (if conditions are at issue)</li>
<li>Reasonable default provisions and notice requirements</li>
<li>Preservation of defenses when needed</li>
</ul></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Motions, Hearings, and Trials</h2><p>
Some matters require motion practice or a hearing/trial. The firm prepares cases with an evidence-first approach: documents, credible witnesses, and a coherent narrative.
When the goal is settlement, being prepared to litigate often improves negotiating leverage.
