  <div class="card"><h2>What a Yellowstone Injunction Is</h2><p>
A Yellowstone injunction is a court order that can toll a cure period and maintain the status quo, allowing a commercial tenant to litigate the merits of an alleged default without risking forfeiture of the lease.
These applications are often time-sensitive and require careful papers: affidavits, the lease, notices, and proof of the tenant’s willingness and ability to cure if necessary.
</p></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Why Timing Matters</h2><p>
Courts often scrutinize whether the application was brought promptly and before termination. Missing the window can eliminate the remedy.
If you receive a notice to cure or notice of termination, speak with counsel quickly and preserve all documents.
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Review the lease’s notice and cure provisions</li>
<li>Evaluate the alleged default and curability</li>
<li>Prepare emergency motion papers where warranted</li>
</ul></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Typical Requirements Courts Consider (General)</h2><p class="muted">Exact standards depend on facts and precedent; the firm evaluates your posture and urgency.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Existence of a commercial lease</li>
<li>Receipt of a notice to cure/termination and threat of forfeiture</li>
<li>Application made before termination</li>
<li>Tenant’s ability and willingness to cure (where curable)</li>
</ul></div><div class="hr"></div><div class="card"><h2>Related Commercial Lease Disputes</h2><p>
Yellowstone applications often arise alongside broader litigation: lease interpretation, alleged defaults, use restrictions, repairs/alterations, assignment/sublet disputes, and rent-related issues.
The firm approaches these matters as full litigation—not just emergency motion practice—building a record to support favorable resolution.
